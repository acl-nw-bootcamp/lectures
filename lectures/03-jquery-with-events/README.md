## Learning Objectives
* Create event listeners using jQuery's `$.on()`
* Distinguish when to use event delegation.
* Select and target HTML elements using the `data` attribute.
* Run our scripts when the DOM is ready using `$(document).ready()`


### Yesterday vs Today
| Yesterday we... | Today we will... |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| <ul><li> used jQuery's data method to add data to elements.</li><li> used the DOM's addEventListener method to listen bind event handlers.</li><li> ran our scripts as soon as they loaded.</li></ul> | <ul><li> use jQuery's data method to update an element's data attributes. </li><li> use jQuery's on method to bind event handlers. </li><li> run our scrips when the document is ready. </li></ul> |

## Notes

* jQuery Events
    * Review
        * Vanilla JS events recap (pg. 244)
        * Connect the concept of events with the DOM
        * Common browser events
        * Events are handled by callback functions
        * Understanding ancestry of the DOM, how to traverse to child nodes
        * Event handling can be used to override default behavior (like link click, or form submit)
    * jQuery events
        * Examples: click, change/input, scroll
        * With jQuery, event listeners should be registered with `$.on()`
        * `$.on()`
            * Read through the `$.on()` method documentation.
            * Discuss `$.on()` with and without delegation.
        * Event delegation
            * Discuss dynamically created and inserted elements, event bubbling, and event propagation.
  * Demo
    * Hand-rolled page tabs
        * Tabs are a common page idiom that can be implemented with a little jQuery
    * Event delegation with  jQuery
    * Getting input values
        * HTML attributes vs JS props
