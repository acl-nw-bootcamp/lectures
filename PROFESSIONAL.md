## Learning Journals
### Today I Learned...

One of the most effective tools in adult learning is reflection. By writing coherent summaries of some lesson learned, we cement that learning and deepen our understanding of a subject.

### Tasks

Every **Monday and Sunday**, write an entry in your learning journal. On Mondays, include your expectations for the week. And on Sunday, reflect on how your week went. In addition, document things that you've learned as well as your experience learning them. Your entry may contain code samples, links to additional resources you found, or anything else you feel is relevant. We have found a correlation between students who write consistently in their journals, and students who succeed in class. Take this assignment seriously.


- Create a gist with the file name `learning-journal.md`. You can make it a public or private gist. (If you have one from 201, feel free to continue using the same gist.)
- Add a Table of Content that links to each day's entry
    - Markdown links look like this: `[link text](link url)`
    - You can link to a header within the same file (just like in HTML!) by using a `#`, like so: `[Class 08](#Class-08)` 
    - Note that spaces are replaced with `-`'s.
- For each entry, add an `h1` header with at least the class number: `Class 08` or `Day 8`. You can include the date and an actual title if you'd like. Write your entry underneath this header. 
- Write to your heart's content. Write about what you learned, what may or may not have happened in group work, what you're hoping for, etc. This is for your own reflection more than it is just another thing for us to assess you on.

See [this sample](https://gist.github.com/sajoy/e978863dd14dc20ddf1dd97ba4def6c5) for an idea of how it should look.

### Submitting Your Work

Please paste a link to your gist into Canvas. This assignment is due before the start of the next class.


## Professional Presence
Each Thursday you will submit proof of growing your professional presence. Choose an option to pursue throughout 301. You only need to fulfill one.

### Submitting your work
In Canvas, write a couple sentences about what progress you made. Include any expected information as outlined below, as well as any relevant links (i.e. your Medium account or links to Meetups you're looking considering).

### Option 1: Write a technical blog post
This can be about whatever avenue of programming or web development in which you are interested. Write a tutorial or about a bug you're proud of figuring out or a subject that you learned 201. Choosing a specific subject (for example, outlining your process of understanding the DOM) will make for more compelling writing as well as make it easier to write.

| Week | Expectation |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Week 1 - 2 | Sign up for a [Medium](http://www.medium.com) account |
| Week 3 - 4 | Brainstorm ideas, and write an outline for your top pick  |
| Week 5 - 6 | Have a final draft complete  |


### Option 2: Gain rank in Code Wars
Doing code challenges offers you extra practice as well as helps you build critical, analytical, and problem solving skills. Working on such challenges can also be great for networking because solving them gives you something to talk about with potential workplaces. The goal of this option is to be ranked at 6 kyu by the end of week 6 (you start at 8 kyu). For submission please also include a screenshot of your stats page.

| Week | Expectation |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Week 1 - 2 | Sign up for an account at [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/) |
| Week 3 - 4 | Show progress in your rank  |
| Week 5 - 6 | Reach the rank of 6 kyu  |


### Option 3: Attend a Meetup
Attend at least one Meetup in person. Resources for finding meetups include: [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/) and [calagator.org](http://calagator.org/)

| Week | Expectation |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Week 1 - 2 | Research local Meetups that you're interested in |
| Week 3 - 4 | Update with more research information or your Meetup experience(s)  |
| Week 5 - 6 | Update with more research information or your Meetup experience(s)  |
